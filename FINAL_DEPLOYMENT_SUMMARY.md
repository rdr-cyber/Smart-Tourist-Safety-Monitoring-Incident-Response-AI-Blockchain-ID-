### CSS Implementation
Created unique gradient backgrounds for each destination using India-inspired color palettes:

```css
.taj-mahal-bg { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #8B0000 0%, #B22222 50%, #CD5C5C 100%); }
.gateway-of-india-bg { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #000080 0%, #4169E1 50%, #87CEEB 100%); }
.hawa-mahal-bg { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FF8C00 0%, #FFA500 50%, #FFD700 100%); }
.india-gate-bg { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #228B22 0%, #32CD32 50%, #90EE90 100%); }
.kedarnath-temple-bg { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #2F4F4F 0%, #696969 50%, #A9A9A9 100%); }
.jagannath-temple-bg { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #800080 0%, #9932CC 50%, #DA70D6 100%); }
.qutub-minar-bg { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #8B4513 0%, #A0522D 50%, #D2691E 100%); }
.mysore-palace-bg { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4B0082 0%, #8A2BE2 50%, #9370DB 100%); }
```

### Component Integration
All components have been updated to use CSS classes instead of image files:

```jsx
<Box className={zone.imageClass}>
  {/* Visual content with gradient background */}
</Box>
```

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites
1. Vercel account
2. Node.js (v14 or higher)
3. Git (optional, for Git-based deployment)

### Deployment Steps
1. Navigate to the `web-app` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Deploy using one of these methods:
   - **Vercel Dashboard**: Import project and configure settings
   - **Vercel CLI**: Run `vercel --prod` for direct deployment

### Configuration
- **Framework**: Create React App
- **Build Command**: `npm run vercel-build`
- **Output Directory**: `build`
- **Environment Variables**: Configure as needed in Vercel dashboard
