### 2. Purpose Limitation
- Data is collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes
- Data is not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes
- Purpose specification is provided at the time of data collection

### 3. Data Minimization
- Only data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary is collected
- Regular data audits ensure minimal data retention
- Data anonymization techniques are applied where possible

### 4. Accuracy
- Personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
- Inaccurate data is promptly corrected or erased
- Tourists can update their information through the system

### 5. Storage Limitation
- Personal data is kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary
- Automated data deletion mechanisms are implemented for expired data
- Regular data purging schedules are maintained

### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality
- Personal data is processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security
- Encryption, pseudonymization, and other security measures protect data
- Unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction is prevented
